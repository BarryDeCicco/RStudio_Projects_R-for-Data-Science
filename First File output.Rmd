## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r set up libraries}
check.and.install.Package<-function(package_name){
    if(!package_name%in%installed.packages()){
        install.packages(package_name)
    }
}
check.and.install.Package("nycflights13")
check.and.install.Package("tidyverse")
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r summaries}
flights
View(flights)
```

## Demonstrate dplyr functions:



```{r dplyr_demo, }
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
